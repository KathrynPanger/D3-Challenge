          <h2>Visualizing The Effect of Income on Health</h2>

          <p>This project demonstrates the use of D3 to depict state-level US census data on the correlation between income levels and obesity rates for each state.</p>

          <p>This simple scatterplot implies the existence of a negative linear relationship between income levels and obesity rates. A more thorough analysis would examine the statistical significance of this relationship by regressing many predictive factors in related models, and evaluating each one for significance and appropriate levels of multicolinearity (among other things). This simple visualization is more illustrative than demonstrative. Researchers have known for many years that higher income rates are associated with lower levels of obesity. The exteraneous unmeasured variables include food prices (less healthy foods are cheaper on average) and access to locations which sell healthy food. At the individual level, this manifests as higher risk factors for poor health. Here we see the aggregate effects at the state level, where greater health risks, like a lower income, lead to higher rates of health problems, like obesity.</p>
